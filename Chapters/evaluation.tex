\chapter{Evaluation}

In this chapter we will provide a final evaluation regarding the results of this work. Initially, we will provide an approximation on the amount of test coverage that we were able to provide on the Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operation application with the analyzed business processes. Then, we will elaborate on the total resources needed in order to acquire the required knowledge and, after that, to apply said knowledge in order to create the required test cases. Finally, we will give a general insight regarding the usefulness of the project with a particular focus on the applicability that it would have in a real-world scenario where the client feedback would be involved in the process.
